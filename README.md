- 4rth step & final step - it downloads the tiktok video and rename/saving both mp4 and the new json file with the new name template.

## Name template 
- You can customize the name template as you wish based on all the above fields.
- As a default option, name is constructed as following in that order: upload_date (in form of +%Y-%m-%d), uploader, track, artist, & description  
- Specifically: `echo $upload_dt_ok"-""@"$uploaderid_grp"_tr_"$track_grp"-art_"$artist_grp"_dscr_"$descr_short_ok | sed "s/ /_/g" | sed "s/__/_/g" | awk -v n="$max_chars" '{print substr($0, 1, n)}' | transcribe_replace   );`
- Because there ir a system restrain on filename lenghts, max character restrains used on these chosen fields:
-  max characters in filename is set at final stage to 150.
-  Date has by default 11 characters (in form of 2025-12-31) - why 11 and not 10? I dont know
-  upload(username)=25 - username cannot exists 24 characters in tiktok (as of May 2025)
-  track - max characters 40 
-  artist - max characters 60
-  Description lenght is based on max characters allowed without the lenght 




       
        ntrack=40;
        nartist=60;
        
        max_chars=150;
        echo "upload date raw:" $upload_date_grp;
        echo "upload date edited:"$upload_dt_ok;
        echo "uploaded id:"$uploaderid_grp;
        echo "track:"$track_grp;
        echo "artist:"$artist_grp;
        echo "description:"$descr_grp_ok;

        # echo the number of chars per field
        echo "upload_date nm:"$upload_date_nm;
        echo "uploaderid nm:"$uploaderid_nm;
        echo "track nm:"$track_nm;
        echo "artist nm:"$artist_nm;
        echo "description nm:"$description_nm;
        tot_num=$(($upload_date_nm + $uploaderid_nm+$track_nm+$artist_nm));
        echo "total nm -descr:"$tot_num;
       max_chars=150;
       nm_no_descr=$( expr $max_chars - $tot_num);
       echo "remain nm:"$nm_no_descr;
